<h1>Hello world !</h1>

<p>Welcome in the past of the web ? Do you like it ? <br>Not much to display in these github pages for the moment… At the moment I have only a <a href="https://brumar.github.io/presentations/presentationMindmapping/pres.html">slideshow</a> (in french) about mindmapping done with pandoc markdown and reveal.js.<br>
Maybe more will be available later, as I would like to open more the repository I have done during my PhD (<a href="https://github.com/brumar/WPsolving">this</a> and <a href="https://github.com/brumar/DIANE_syntax">that</a>).
<br>For the moment, I have no professional pages set up anywhere but a dubious blog attempt can be found <a href="brunomart.in/blog">there</a>, and my twitter account is <a href="https://twitter.com/itc4efficiency">there</a>.</p>
<p>Main interests : python, mindmapping, memory techniques, web developpement, statistics, cognitive modeling.</p>
